# Project: GetOnTracks QA Automation - Python

## Service Overview: GetOnTracks.org
Tracks aka `getontracks.org` is a Todo Management and Productivity tool with a Web GUI and a REST API. The API uses XML as its Payload format. It is a web service designed to help users manage their tasks and projects efficiently. It provides a user-friendly interface for organizing tasks, tracking progress, and collaborating with team members. The service is accessible locally at `http://localhost:3000`. Tracks is an open source application written in Ruby on Rails so is relatively easy to install and use. 

## "Projects" Functionality Description
The `getontracks.org` service includes a "Projects" functionality, which allows users to organize their tasks by grouping them into separate projects. Project management is accessed via the `/projects` endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/projects`).

The main operations available within the "Projects" functionality include:
* **Viewing existing projects:** Users can see a list of all their active and completed projects. For each project, its name, description, and status are displayed.
* **Creating a new project:** Users can initiate the creation of a new project by specifying its name and, optionally, a description. Once created, the project becomes available for adding tasks.
* **Editing a project:** Users can modify the name and description of an existing project.
* **Deleting a project:** Users have the ability to delete a project. Deleting a project results in the removal of all associated tasks.

This functionality is central to organizing the user's workflow within the `getontracks.org` system.
